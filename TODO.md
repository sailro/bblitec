# bblitec TODO

Only unfinished work belongs here. Completed capabilities and measured
baselines belong in [status](docs/status.md) and Git history.

## Constraints

- derive Babylon behavior from the pinned upstream TypeScript
- keep handwritten C++ at the PAL/resource boundary
- preserve tree shaking, provenance, typed records, and C++20 portability
- do not add scene, geometry, or golden-image heuristics
- validate generation, native builds, and relevant parity gates locally

## P0 — Backend portability

### Vulkan

- [ ] Emit SDL-compatible SPIR-V directly from Tint instead of recompiling
  normalized Tint HLSL with DXC.
- [ ] Build and run generated SPIR-V on Linux.
- [ ] Validate depth, clip space, cubemap orientation, and texture color spaces.
- [ ] Validate BRDF LUT and cubemap orientation on Vulkan hardware.
- [ ] Test discrete and integrated adapters.

### Metal

- [ ] Build and run generated MSL on macOS.
- [ ] Validate uniform layout, derivatives, cubemaps, and blending.
- [ ] Validate BRDF LUT and cubemap orientation on Metal hardware.
- [ ] Investigate iOS after macOS is stable.

## P1 — TypeScript compiler coverage

### Modules and functions

- [x] Resolve named local multi-file imports and re-exports.
- [ ] Add namespace/default imports and non-static module initialization.
- [ ] Build a typed user-code IR from `ts.Program`/`TypeChecker` symbols.
- [ ] Move statement, expression, intrinsic, and property lowering into
  focused compiler modules instead of extending the entry compiler monolith.
- [ ] Generate scene-local custom shader variants from supported WGSL IR
  instead of limiting native emission to predeclared variant names.
- [ ] Extend shader IR to composed PBR/Grid/background fragments, then replace
  the remaining renderer-lowerer source-text contracts with parsed shader IR.
- [x] Lower non-generic typed user functions, defaults, and one final return.
- [x] Support lexical block scopes and safe variable shadowing.
- [ ] Lower `if`, `switch`, `for`, `for...of`, and `while`.
- [ ] Generalize typed object and array literals.
- [ ] Add enums, discriminated unions, and narrowing.

### Closures and async

- [ ] Classify escaping and non-escaping closures.
- [ ] Lower general render/update callbacks.
- [ ] Define ownership for escaping captures.
- [ ] Generalize immediate AOT promises and dynamic-import dispatch.
- [ ] Add a native scheduler only for genuinely runtime-dependent async work.

### Classes and objects

- [ ] Lower the required class/method/getter/setter/inheritance subset.
- [ ] Define object identity and ownership.
- [ ] Add optional GC only for cyclic or JavaScript-managed graphs that cannot
  use deterministic ownership.

## P1 — Assets and materials

### glTF

- [ ] Multiple UV sets and texture-coordinate selection.
- [ ] Texture transforms and vertex colors.
- [ ] Sparse accessors and additional primitive modes.
- [ ] Complete glTF animation coverage: scale and STEP channels, multiple
  clips, and richer animation-group controls.
- [ ] Cameras and punctual lights.
- [ ] KTX2/Basis and compression investigations.

### Property animation

- [ ] Generalize property bindings beyond reached mesh `position`,
  `position.x`, `scaling`, and `rotationQuaternion` paths.
- [ ] Generalize animation targets beyond meshes while retaining typed
  compile-time path validation.

### Material extensions

- [ ] Emissive strength, IOR/specular, clearcoat, sheen.
- [ ] Transmission/volume, iridescence, anisotropy.
- [ ] Require typed metadata specialization, focused tests, and a non-BoomBox
  parity scene for each extension.
- [ ] Generalize Standard lighting beyond the reached two-light uniform slice.

### Shader provenance

- [ ] Replace the pinned converted native PBR WGSL with direct extraction from
  Babylon Lite's full feature composer.

### Packed native assets

- [ ] Define a versioned native scene format with deterministic hashes.
- [ ] Prepack geometry, materials, textures, hierarchy, and animation data.
- [ ] Retain source loaders for development and parity.
- [ ] Measure startup, runtime, and size tradeoffs.

## P1 — Runtime and validation

- [ ] Add generation-checked handles and resource lifetime/leak checks.
- [ ] Add dirty flags and incremental GPU updates.
- [ ] Add device-loss and resize-safe resource recreation.
- [ ] Add multiple registered scenes and scene switching.
- [ ] Add headless renderer tests.
- [ ] Add differential tests for camera, environment, material, and transform
  functions.
- [ ] Add malformed asset and backend-layout tests.
- [ ] Add a validation bundle command that preserves artifacts on failure.

## P1 — Developer experience

- [ ] Add portable CMake presets.
- [ ] Improve missing-tool and stale-output diagnostics.
- [ ] Add `--explain-feature` and generated-code-to-upstream inspection.
- [ ] Document adding a lowerer and curated scene fixture.

## P2 — Platform and performance

- [ ] Add touch, gamepad, and fuller keyboard mapping.
- [ ] Inventory and lower static audio playback behind an SDL audio PAL.
- [ ] Add runtime HTTP/files only when compile-time materialization is
  insufficient.
- [ ] Keep physics behind an independent PAL/dependency boundary.
- [ ] Separate CPU submission, GPU execution, decode, and startup timing.
- [ ] Track executable, shader, and asset sizes consistently.
- [ ] Deduplicate resources and batch uploads before investigating meshlets,
  indirect draws, or GPU-driven culling.

## Documentation maintenance

- [ ] Keep status metrics and the README comparison image synchronized with
  validated results.
- [ ] Update development and repository instructions when build workflows or
  recurring pitfalls change.
- [ ] Keep this file free of completed-history checklists.
