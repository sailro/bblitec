// Scene 168 — Mirrored Double-Sided Winding (bundled-build regression).
//
// Two identical double-sided quads under an IBL: one with a plain transform, one under a
// negative-scale node. The negative scale makes the mirrored quad's net world determinant
// POSITIVE (glTF geometry is authored for the negative-determinant space the loader's RH->LH
// `__root__` flip creates), which reverses its triangle winding.
//
// Why this scene exists
// ---------------------
// A mirrored mesh must have its pipeline `frontFace` flipped ccw->cw. WebGPU derives
// `@builtin(front_facing)` from `frontFace`, and the double-sided PBR shader flips the shading
// normal when a fragment is not front-facing. Get the winding wrong and that flip fires on the
// VISIBLE side instead: the outward normal is inverted, N·V goes negative, and the quad loses its
// lighting and renders near-black.
//
// The scenes that already cover mirrored glTF nodes (257 / 266 / 269) do not catch this. Their
// mirrored meshes are shaped and lit such that flipping `frontFace` changes no pixels — verified by
// forcing the wrong winding and re-rendering them. This scene is deliberately built so the flip is
// the ONLY thing separating a lit quad from a black one, and both quads are on screen so the
// mirrored one is compared against its unmirrored twin.
//
// It is a BUNDLED-build regression in particular: the winding used to be installed by importing
// a module purely for its side effect, which the scene bundler tree-shakes away (nothing reads a
// binding from it). Source builds kept it, so only a bundled scene shows the failure.
//
// Flat quads with no texture: nothing here depends on UVs, tangents or mips, so a difference can
// only come from the winding.
