/**
 * Antigravity Racer — Babylon Lite demo.
 *
 * A native port of Cédric Guillemet's "Antigravity racing game" Babylon.js
 * playground (snippet WVPVWL#0): fly a hover-ship around a closed, banked loop
 * track threaded through 7 editable control points, racing AI opponents,
 * boosting off energy strips, in single-player, 2-player split-screen,
 * attract/demo, or track-editor modes.
 *
 * What is ported verbatim: the 7 control points, the arc-length spline sampling,
 * the 256-segment procedural track piece, the per-segment frame data and the
 * deformation vertex shader that bends that straight piece onto the spline, the
 * exact per-tick physics/AI, the ship transforms, cameras, engine trails,
 * lighting, black sky, height-mapped terrain and cascaded shadows, the exact
 * rock transforms, the road artwork and compositing of the playground's node
 * material (snippet 01HFES#76 — track textures by Patrick Ryan, committed here
 * with his permission), and the two CC BY 4.0 Sketchfab models the playground
 * loads (ship "RHS-X" by Hassan Bassassi, rock "Obj_Nat_Rock_01" by
 * SaschaHenrichs) — committed locally as self-contained GLBs.
 * The playground's own `heightMap.png` / `ground.jpg` are fetched from
 * playground.babylonjs.com at runtime rather than redistributed.
 *
 * What is original: the DOM menus/HUD/pause overlay, the QWERTY/AZERTY-independent
 * keyboard and gamepad support, and the fixed 60 Hz clock the playground's
 * per-tick formulas run on (see `docs/lite/architecture/demo-antigravity-racer.md`).
 *
 * Split into focused modules (see `antigravity-racer/`): track spline math +
 * deformation/shadow material, ship simulation, instanced ship/rock models,
 * storage-buffer trails, camera rigs, keyboard+gamepad input, DOM menu/HUD, and
 * the track editor — see `game.ts` for how they're wired together.
 *
 * Controls: W/A/S/D (or ZQSD) + arrows to drive, C / shoulder buttons to
 * cycle camera, Esc / Start to pause. Gamepad supported throughout, including
 * menu navigation.
