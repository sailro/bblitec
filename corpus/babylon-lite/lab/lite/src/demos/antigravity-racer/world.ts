/**
 * Antigravity Racer — the persistent world (lighting + deformed track + boulders + terrain + shadows).
 *
 * The playground has ONE world for the whole session: `createScene` builds the
 * track, the boulders, the terrain and the cascaded shadows once, and every mode
 * (`initPlay`, `initEditing`) reuses them. This module reproduces that lifetime:
 * {@link createRacerWorlds} runs exactly once per page and its resources — the
 * 600-subdivision height-mapped ground, the boulder pool, the track pieces and
 * the CSM depth arrays — live until the page goes away. The presentation layer
 * doubles the ground footprint and adds subtle blue distance fog. Mode switching only
 * builds and disposes scenes, cameras, HUD and the ship grid.
 *
 * **Why more than one "render world".** A CSM generator fits its cascades to ONE
 * camera and owns one shadow-task state, so the two split-screen panes cannot
 * share one: whichever pane rendered last would own the cascades, and the other
 * player's shadows would be wrong or missing. Each pane therefore gets its own
 * {@link RenderWorld} — its own directional light, its own CSM generator, and its
 * own track receiver/caster material pair, since that material samples the
 * cascade array of the generator it was built against. Everything that is
 * camera-independent is shared: the terrain mesh, the boulder pool, the ship
 * models and the spline source. Those are added to both panes' scenes, where Lite
 * builds a per-scene renderable that binds that pane's own generator.
 *
 * The secondary world is built on the first split-screen race and then kept, so
 * repeated 2P races reuse it. Nothing ever disposes a world: the demo has no
 * teardown below the page itself (the same lifetime `loadRacerAssets` gives the
 * models), so world resources are released when the page goes away.
 *
 * Lighting and shadows are the racer's original setup: a 0.5-intensity
 * hemispheric light aimed at (1, 1, 0), a unit directional light travelling
 * (-1, -2, -1) from (120, 50, 100), and a 1024² four-cascade
 * CSM with lambda 1, bias 0.001 and shadowMaxZ 1500 (BJS `usePercentageCloserFiltering`
 * ⇒ Lite's PCF5 receiver). The visible HDR sky is attached to each mode scene by
 * `environment.ts`. Casters are the ships, the boulders and the deformed
 * track; receivers are the terrain, the boulders and the track.
